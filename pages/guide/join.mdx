dakopay.com allows merchants to generate subscription plans on the blockchain for recurring payments with its easy to use interface. Merchants can generate a subscription link by adding an appropriate token address and receiver address from the blockchain of their choice. Merchants can forward their generated subscription link to their clients or users.
