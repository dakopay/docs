# Repa.gg  Create

Repa.gg is a DeFi payments application which enables trustless recurring payments on different blockchains using ERC20 tokens powered by smart contracts. Merchants can create recurring payment plans in crypto using Repa.gg, where the incurring subscription charges are stored in the smart contract from which they can collect the desired amount from the user for as long as the subscription applies. It is up to merchant to decide the frequency of the recurring payments (daily, weekly or monthly).

Repa.gg has a wide range of use cases; influencers, gamers, NGO’s/charities are now able to use a system for receiving recurring crypto payments. 

Pre-requisites :

MetaMask extension installed on the browser
At least one wallet created or imported

Like any recurring payment solution, even Repa.gg works within boundaries that are defined by mandate parameters. These parameters are as follows:

Choosing the network (Binance Smart Chain, Polygon etc.)
Entering the Token address and receivers address
Amount type: Cost per day


Choosing the network —

While using this application to create a recurring subscription plan, we have to specify the blockchain which we are going to use, be it Binance Smart Chain or Polygon.

Entering the Token address —

A token address is the address from which payments are withdrawn in order to join a subscription plan. The token address can hold any token supported by RePa (i.e. any ERC20 token). The users must choose which token to utilize as their cryptocurrency of choice to pay for their subscription plan.

Enter the receiver address —

The receiver address or merchant address is where the recurring payments from the subscription plan will be sent to.

Merchants can set the cost per day and also there is the ability to charge an initial fee (i.e. initial days). If there are initial fees specified in the plan, they pay for that period of time upfront. After clicking the ‘generate link’ button, the subscription plan is generated and merchants can simply share this link to their clients.
