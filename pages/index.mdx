The DAKOPAY protocol integrates frictionless with merchant applications, making recurring payments easy and providing a truly global solution for recurring payments in the DeFi sector.

Automatic crypto payments are not possible without sharing your private key which defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency and self-custody wallets. There is a complicated method (EIP-1337) that already exists but it creates more problems than it solves. DeFi is growing exponentially and with this growth came a challenge to allow subscriptions on blockchain. EIP-1337 tried to solve the majority of this but failed miserably as merchants and users couldn’t deploy contracts for each plan they create. Now with DAKOPAY, these problems are no more.

dakopay.com aims to provide an alternative to traditional banking payments based on smart contracts, making recurring payments possible and easy in the DeFi space. It’s use cases are endless.
